      <h1> Site-19 </h1>
      Site-19 is a site run by the SCP Foundation, tasked with containing and protecting anomalous objects which defy our knowledge. <br>
      It is currently only open to employees, and is highly classified, so the only way to go in is to volunteer as a D-Class.<br>
      There are really only two hotel options here. There are the D-Class cells, for those who fulfill the role of test subject, and then there's anomaly containment, if you happen to be an anomaly yourself.<br>
