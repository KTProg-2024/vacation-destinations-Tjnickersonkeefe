      <h1> The Void of Space </h1>
      Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction. Physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions, although modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime.<br>
      You can go to space with a spaceship, though these tend to be a pricier option. You could always just hitchhike with aliens, though.<br>
      You're gonna have to sleep in your space ship, or youre gonna have to park at the ISS. Either way, neither is a good option.
